# Biophysically Detailed Network Model of the LGN with Triadic Synapses

This model of the triadic circuitry of the mouse LGN was developed by myself, Patrick McCarthy, as well as Laura Lazzari and Jonathan Martin under the supervision of Professor Simon Schultz of Imperial College London's Neural Coding and Neurodegenerative Disease Lab. It was subsequently used to investigate temporal selectivity as a possible function of triadic synapses in the LGN. This work culminated in a conference paper which can be found here: https://doi.org/10.11159/icbes20.126
