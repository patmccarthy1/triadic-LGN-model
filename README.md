# Biophysically Detailed Model of the mouse LGN with triadic synapses

As part of my Masters group project for my degree, I worked with two others to develop this biophysical model of the mouse LGN which is one of the first models to incorporate the somewhat elusive triadic synapse. The development version is hosted on another repository which is owned by one of my teammates, but I have uploaded the final version here.
