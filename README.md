# Biophysically Detailed Model of the LGN with triadic synapses

As part of my Masters group project for my degree, I worked with two others to develop this biophysical model of the mouse LGN which is one of the first models to incorporate the somewhat elusive triadic synapse. The development version is hosted on another repository which is owned by one of my teammates and can be found here: https://github.com/jmckmartin/triadicLGN2020. I have uploaded the final published version for the purpose of viewing my work easily.
